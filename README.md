üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Bhasker Dubey

I combine deep expertise in business operations with AI and automation to reimagine how teams work. Over the past 3 years, I‚Äôve been designing and implementing AI-powered workflows, RAG systems, and automation agents that reduce manual effort, unlock efficiencies, and free people to focus on higher-value work.

üí° What I work on

- AI workflow automation: Built n8n workflows that connect HubSpot, Gmail, Google Sheets, and OpenAI to automate escalation resolution and client communications.

- Intelligent data workflows: Designed automations to read and process Excel files row-by-row, scrape company career pages, and extract job postings using OpenAI.

- RAG + agent prototypes: Created AI support and consultant agents for The UpTree, enabling retrieval-based answers from live client files in OneDrive.

- Operational systems: Designed and implemented Supabase row-level security policies and structured integrations between CRMs, databases, and automation layers.

- Enablement & playbooks: Built process templates and automation examples that others can adopt, customize, and scale.
